          <h2>Why I stopped posting on social media</h2>
          <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">Watch this if you want to watch experts talking about this</a>)  Once upon a time, Facebook was exciting and charming. There were multiple posts and updates regularly posted and updates from others regularly checked. This was a time when I enjoyed the likes and comments and craved for more. Soon I joined Facebook groups and started tailoring my posts for maximum positive response. It was no longer just sharing but attention-seeking and near-religious obedience to social media-friendly practices. You upvote all your friends’ posts and tag them, you don’t express a divergent opinion, you have to be witty in your expression, and many more. The fun of Facebook soon started fading as more and more of my family members started following me and I started to censure my online presence. But the new start of social media for me was Reddit. Free of societal censure and a friendly subreddit for almost anything soon captured my need for open spaces. But Reddit also faces the same restrictions as Facebook and that is what upsets me most about social media. The very essence of them is to make you engage with them and promote expression. It takes a more sinister form in the case of Facebook and its other avatars with subvert manipulation, coercion to share more information, and ultimately bundling that user data into commodities. Reddit takes a bit more innocuous approach by avoiding commodification of data and providing a higher degree of privacy. But the dopamine addiction of social media reached its peak for me with Reddit and r/memes. I had started amassing Karma to become eligible to post on r/memes and the grind was real. And this is the biggest problem I have with social media, the dopamine-fueled compulsion to post and share. Again Facebook and its avatars are much much worse at this and deploy your own brain chemistry against you. Lack of filters for bullshit news, influencers promoting unrealistic body standards, promotion of polarising content, and outdated social evils are not bugs but features of social media which we all enjoy (enjoyed). The more you engage with social media the more it changes you. Slowly and steadily it gives incentives to behave and project yourself in a certain way and the manipulatory techniques get better they study your habits and make more and more addictive algorithms. For me not being subject to the biggest involuntary human experiment is certainly appealing and so is stopping my free will and quirks from eroding. So the reason I stopped posting on social media is not that I hate it or it is boring (this is true btw) but it is simply too dangerous for my own psyche.

          <h2>Fine-tuning my bullshit detector</h2>
          <p> I was at my best friend’s house, surrounded by her relatives, we all were talking about a myriad of topics and suddenly she made a weird comment. “Do you know that plants die when given water heated in a microwave?” My reaction was of laughter and ridicule considering the overall implausibility of the claim. She was committed to defending her claim and we started throwing arguments. She didn’t remember the source (fuck you WhatsApp), was uncertain about the mechanisms via which such a phenomenon could be explained, and certainly hadn’t tried it. She didn’t concede though, her counterclaims included things like maybe there is some unknown mechanism and if I am too skeptical I should go out and try it myself. Soon her family joined in too who collectively labeled me a skeptic who needs research papers to trust things. This got me thinking, was I actually wrong? So I went online and searched for this supposed phenomenon and found nada to support it. A similar thing happened while watching a youtube video of a supposed spiritual leader who cited research done by his own foundation to support his claims of planetary motion affecting our daily lives. In both of the cases, my bullshit detector went off because I knew that they cannot be true based on my knowledge of physics and biology. Water heated by microwave doesn’t magically change chemical composition to become poisonous for plants and planets don’t affect your lives. The real question is what other bullshit facts I swallowed because my bullshit detector laid dormant. The pattern for detection was my biases, I distrusted astrology, and consider certain people to be gullible, so the pattern for misses has to be the same. Things that seemed correctly aligned with my worldview, political and social believes might have been missed. I guess a similar thing happened with my friend, whose mistrust of modern contraptions and insistence on old ways might have made her ignore her really substantial knowledge of botany and physics. I must have my blind spots too, relying on evidence-based veracity detection is not always possible and it still leaves me open for improper research, corporately funded research biases and makes me vulnerable to people who sound like experts. Most importantly relying on evidence doesn’t work on opinions. Opinions like this cake is good could be subjectively true and claims like religion is good for society are hard to access in few seconds. So I thought of coming up with another filter that takes these things into account. “Cigarette filters make smoking safer” is a good example of such a bullshit fact. Sounds legit, is repeatedly told by smart people who smoke, and is an utterly made-up marketing ploy. They slightly reduce the tar deposition in your lungs but don’t make a huge difference overall. How about advice given by gym trainers to exercise a particular body part to reduce fat content around it, utter bullshit. So the first lesson, don’t trust people who sound smart or expert without some basic inquiry. How does it work? Why does it happen this way? If they don’t demonstrate a deeper understanding of the subject they might be knowingly or unknowingly bullshiting me. This still leaves the first example untouched, a friend who knows far more botany than I could not be trusted on botany facts. So the second filter has to be checking for biases and possible motives for the messenger who is bestowing the knowledge onto you. Still not a perfect art but this does make a significant improvement in my current strategy.
