                <b> What is Linux Mint:</b> <br>

                <a href='https://linuxmint.com/'>Linux Mint</a> is a modern,
                elegant, and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use. It is based on Debian
                and Ubuntu and its Cinnamon desktop environment makes it very intuitive for Windows users. In short, it
                is what I was looking for when I decided I had enough of Windows shenanigans. <br> <br>
                <b>Why Linux Mint:</b> <br>

                Linux usually sounds like something nerdy programmers use and too complex for normal folks but Mint (or
                Linux in general) is anything but that. If you only use your laptop for web browsing, and saving your
                family photos then there is nothing simpler than Mint. It looks and behaves like Microsoft Windows but
                unlike Windows, it doesn’t steal your data and hide important settings. Bad things like viruses and
                spyware won’t get on your laptop even without an antivirus (magical isn’t it) and it works on even
                decade-old machines. My reason for switching to (dual booting with Windows actually) was very simple, I
                wanted my malfunctioning inbuilt keyboard to stop working. I tried everything deleting drivers,
                uninstalling the device, changing group policy but windows would always go ahead and add it back
                regardless. So after wrestling with windows for few weeks I just gave up and dual-booted with Linux Mint
                and I am have lived happily ever after! <br> <br>
                <b> My experience:
                </b> <br>
                I shifted to Mint nearly 3 months ago and I am absolutely loving it. The journey had its ups and downs
                and breakdown but it was worth it. Everything was working right out of the box and the software manager
                had almost everything I wanted. Finding the right tools on Linux could be a bit challenging depending on
                how flexible you are but it’s never impossible. It is especially easy on Mint as almost everything you
                need comes prepackaged with the ISO image. Here (resources) is a link to common programs I had to
                install on my Mint. The search for programs was a really interesting one and made me appreciate the
                beauty of FOSS (free and open-source software). It is really a shame that we don’t have enough of them.
                <br> <br>

                <b> Installation:
                </b> <br>
                Mint install is very is easy and there are tons of <a
                    href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svno4shb3GY'>youtube videos</a> to guide you through it. Once
                you have it installed it’s done. You forget that you have an OS and keep using that PC for decades
                without anything breaking. <br> <br>
                <b>Beautification:</b> <br>

                If I didn't like one thing about the Mint it has to be the looks. Though it has all the modern features
                the desktop looks straight out of the 90s. But there is a lot you can do. From making it look like
                Windows 10, XP, 97, 95 to making it look like MacOS is all possible and easy. For me copying other OS
                was not very appealing so I just started customizing everything and anything I could find.
