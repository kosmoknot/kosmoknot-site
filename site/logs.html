I went on a night trek starting from the base of the fort towards the Palli gate. We reached there around 2:30 and then set up tents. There was supposed to be a sleeping break but 4 of us went on to trek towards the “Balekilla” (upper fort) and other parts till 4:30 am. Which was followed by a group hike to Sanjivani Machee to witness the sunrise. After that glorious encounter, we began a  sleep-deprived and exhausted descent.

                  <p>Expectations are always high for a Cohen bros film, and this one does deliver on them. After watching a few of their films, the style becomes familiar. Ballad of Buster Scruggs has a lot of that absurd randomnesses, typical of Cohens, along with some heartfelt moments.  There is much foreshadowing with poems like Ozymandias or with the clothing choices, but it doesn't always lead to expected outcomes. Starting with a fast-paced, upbeat, blood-filled, and satirical short, the movie slows down little by little, to a bloodless frightful conversation, while exploring a lot of things on the way.  Nature is harsh, vast, and at its full glory, making characters appear more helpless than they should be.</p>

                  <p>Even after so many years of movie-making, the narrative and style of Casablanca feel fresh. It truly does brings out the sentimentalist in everyone, no matter how skeptical you are about the movie. While being a romance, it still feels very unique due to its fast-paced and plot-heavy nature.  It sneakily addresses many things like American isolationism, the moral dilemma of ignorance, and the centrality of virtues, while you're enthralled by brilliant performances.</p>

                  <p>This one is a highly underrated movie. The story is simple and mostly told visually. It creates tension by using previously shown information, character traits and manages to make even the most ordinary scene into an emotionally packed drama.</p>

                  <p>Watched it in parts while traveling. This is a high school drama about a group of students self-reflecting and accepting themselves and each other. Would have enjoyed it far more if the context was Indian. Good to watch with teens.</p>

                  <p>White Tiger by Arvind Adiga is one of the most upsetting books I have ever read (along with Dostoyevsky). The film captures that mood of discomfort and delivers an unfiltered Indian reality. Only if India could produce more of such original content (alas!). Everything from political references and vulgarity to villages and cites felt relatable while making them feel equally bastardized.</p>

                  <p>It is a true masterpiece with bold ambitions, stunning visuals, and eargasmic music of A.R. Rehman.

                  <p>A slow-paced character study that steadily unfolds situations around protagonists beautifully. The movie takes you to the 1980s in Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania and explore's the era through 2 women trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. The socialist dictatorship and the impact it had on the lives of common people are beautifully shown without saying much directly. The bleakness of the country is readily apparent, economic mismanagement and socialist weirdness stand out anytime an official with even a minute of authority speaks. The movie is also shot through the perspective of college youth, hopefully dreaming of better lives in a dystopian present, showing the contrast between their aspirations and reality.</p>

                  <div class="collapsible_content">
                  <p>This is a unique film that actually benefits from its typical Bollywood style by making it more approachable to its target audience. There is much drama that surprisingly serves a purpose in the film and weaves all the story threads together while delivering a coherent and meaningful narrative. Rather than taking a route of oversimplification into good vs evil categories, the movie introduces a large cast of side characters and explores nuances through their web of interconnected experiences and realizations while also making most of them relatable and likable. In a Bollywood mainstream filled to the brim with toxic masculinity, this feels like a fresh breeze of rational criticism of the status quo which is much welcome.</p>

                  <p> Feels pretty grounded for a crime drama with redneck poppy farmers, Mexican drug cartel and money launderers. Each character is unique and has a satisfying story arc. BTW those children are pretty dope.</p>

                  <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put together a weirdly unique combination of tropes in Killing Eve. It has assassins, MI6, too many lesbian and gay characters blended together in a stylized story which doesn’t take itself too seriously. The humor, action, and romance all get better in 2nd season and again near the end of the 3rd season. 2nd season felt very similar to but far better than Hanibal and things took interesting turn in the 3rd season. High hopes for the 4th one.</p>
