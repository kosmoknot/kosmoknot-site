              <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajgad_Fort">Rajgad</a>, formerly known as Murumdevs is one of
                the best-preserved forts in Maharastra and served as an early capital of the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire">Maratha Empire</a> for 26 years. I went on a night
                trek starting from the base of the fort towards the Palli gate. We reached there around 2:30 and then
                set up tents. There was supposed to be a sleeping break but 4 of us went on to trek towards the
                “Balekilla” (upper fort) and other parts till 4:30 am. Which was followed by a group hike to Sanjivani
                Machee to witness the sunrise. After that glorious encounter, we began a sleep-deprived and exhausted
                descent.

                monotonous covering steep cliffs, forest paths, and plane ground. It became slightly challenging near
                the end but the view from the top was worth the trouble. We waited for the sunrise and then headed
                towards the Konkan Kada and nearby temples. Had breakfast at the fort and started our descent.

              <p>Expectations are always high for a Cohen bros film, and this one does deliver on them. After watching a
                few of their films, the style becomes familiar. Ballad of Buster Scruggs has a lot of that absurd
                randomnesses, typical of Cohens, along with some heartfelt moments. There is much foreshadowing with
                poems like Ozymandias or with the clothing choices, but it doesn't always lead to expected outcomes.
                Starting with a fast-paced, upbeat, blood-filled, and satirical short, the movie slows down little by
                little, to a bloodless frightful conversation, while exploring a lot of things on the way. Nature is
                harsh, vast, and at its full glory, making characters appear more helpless than they should be.</p>

              <p>Even after so many years of movie-making, the narrative and style of Casablanca feel fresh. It truly
                does brings out the sentimentalist in everyone, no matter how skeptical you are about the movie. While
                being a romance, it still feels very unique due to its fast-paced and plot-heavy nature. It sneakily
                addresses many things like American isolationism, the moral dilemma of ignorance, and the centrality of
                virtues, while you're enthralled by brilliant performances.</p>

              <p>White Tiger by Arvind Adiga is one of the most upsetting books I have ever read (along with

              <p>A slow-paced character study that steadily unfolds situations around protagonists beautifully. The
                movie takes you to the 1980s in Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania and explore's the era through 2 women trying
                to abort an unwanted pregnancy. The socialist dictatorship and the impact it had on the lives of common
                people are beautifully shown without saying much directly. The bleakness of the country is readily
                apparent, economic mismanagement and socialist weirdness stand out anytime an official with even a
                minute of authority speaks. The movie is also shot through the perspective of college youth, hopefully
                dreaming of better lives in a dystopian present, showing the contrast between their aspirations and
                reality.</p>

              <p>This is a unique film that actually benefits from its typical Bollywood style by making it more

                and weaves all the story threads together while delivering a coherent and meaningful narrative. Rather
                than taking a route of oversimplification into good vs evil categories, the movie introduces a large
                cast of side characters and explores nuances through their web of interconnected experiences and
                realizations while also making most of them relatable and likable. In a Bollywood mainstream filled to
                the brim with toxic masculinity, this feels like a fresh breeze of rational criticism of the status quo
                which is much welcome.</p>

              <p>This movie has an immense influence on Bollywood and you easily notice that watching the movie, you can
                also notice the wild-west influence on the Sholay. Rather than just copy-paste wild west formula, Sholay
                adapted it for the Indian audience making it feel less gritty while adding a lot of comedy. Sholay is
                beautifully shot, has great dialogues, well-developed characters but most importantly it’s entertaining.
                For a 3hr long movie, it stays surprisingly fresh and bounces back and forth between moods while never
                losing the focus. It certainly is a masterpiece that can probably lose unnecessary songs and make
                Basanti less </p>

              <p>The comedy, animation, and decision to make humans speak Japanese really coalesce together to form this

              <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put together a weirdly unique combination of tropes in Killing Eve. It has
                assassins, MI6, too many lesbian and gay characters blended together in a stylized story which doesn’t
                take itself too seriously. The humor, action, and romance all get better in 2nd season and again near
                the end of the 3rd season. 2nd season felt very similar to but far better than Hanibal and things took
                interesting turn in the 3rd season. High hopes for the 4th one.</p>

              <p>I can't believe that I had missed the last season of the wire in my first watch. And trust me the last
                season delivered on all of that build-up, plotlines, character developments, and expectations. The wire
                is not about drugs or police it is about the city of Baltimore and its systemic flaws. The system is
                unwrapped layer by layer starting from drug gangs and police to politicians, schools, newspapers, and
                charities. People inside Baltimore are shaped by this ruthless and self-perpetuating cycle of misery and
                are surprisingly learned to live with it. Everyone knows what needs to be done, some people know how to
                do those things and only a couple ever show the willpower to so. The show is not entirely nihilistic
                rather hand it ends on a happy note with most of the main cast living their lives happily ever after but
                Baltimore remains the same breeding more of the same. There hasn't been any other fictional show (that I
                have watched) more impactful and invigorating than wire and I love wire for that. </p>
