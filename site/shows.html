                            launderers. Each character is unique and has a satisfying story arc. BTW those children

                        <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put together a weirdly unique combination of tropes in Killing
                            Eve. It has
                            assassins, MI6, too many lesbian and gay characters blended together in a stylized story
                            which doesn’t
                            take itself too seriously. The humor, action, and romance all get better in 2nd season
                            and again near
                            the end of the 3rd season. 2nd season felt very similar to but far better than Hanibal
                            and things took
                            interesting turn in the 3rd season. High hopes for the 4th one.</p>

                        <p>I can't believe that I had missed the last season of the wire in my first watch. And
                            trust me the last
                            season delivered on all of that build-up, plotlines, character developments, and
                            expectations. The wire
                            is not about drugs or police it is about the city of Baltimore and its systemic flaws.
                            The system is
                            unwrapped layer by layer starting from drug gangs and police to politicians, schools,
                            newspapers, and
                            charities. People inside Baltimore are shaped by this ruthless and self-perpetuating
                            cycle of misery and
                            are surprisingly learned to live with it. Everyone knows what needs to be done, some
                            people know how to
                            do those things and only a couple ever show the willpower to so. The show is not
                            entirely nihilistic
                            rather hand it ends on a happy note with most of the main cast living their lives
                            happily ever after but
                            Baltimore remains the same breeding more of the same. There hasn't been any other
                            fictional show (that I
                            have watched) more impactful and invigorating than wire and I love wire for that. </p>
